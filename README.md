# https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2018/econ/local/public-use-datasets.html able to change the 2018 down to 2012 to get the datasets as tables.
# more usable data source? https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/gov-finances/tables/
# likey useful to use react & d3 for interactive data vis maybe use matplotlib for static data exploration before?


# Plotly for the data vis; might be useful to review: https://plotly.com/python/choropleth-maps/#customize-choropleth-chart has geometry for states
